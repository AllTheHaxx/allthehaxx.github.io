        <h2 class="headline-red">Getting Error 0xC000007B when starting</h2>
        <blockquote>
          This error means that you are mixing up 32 bit environments with 64 ones, i.e. having a 64-bit executable but 32-bit DLLs in one directory.<br>
          Never do that! If you downloaded say the 64 bit version of the client, stick to that.<br>
          If you for some reason decide that you want the 32 bit version too, keep it in it's own folder.<br>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="headline-red">Everything looks "zoomed in" so that you can't click anything</h2>
        <blockquote>
          This usually appears when your screen has got some weird resolution that nobody else in the world is using.<br>
          To fix it, you can make the interface smaller:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>Open the gameconsole by pressing F1</li>
            <li>Type `ui_scale 80` and press enter</li>
            <li>Go to Settings → Graphics to change either the resolution to something sane (16:9 recommended) or adjust the ui scale</li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="headline-red">Doesn't start on Linux</h2>
        <blockquote>
          If you are trying to run the pre-built client on linux and it just doesn't do anything, it's most likely you'll have to compile it yourself.<br>
          To identify the problem: open a terminal, cd into to your AllTheHaxx folder and type ./AllTheHaxx<br>
          It will say you what's going on.
          <ul>
            <li>If it says 'No Permission', do `chmod +x AllTheHaxx` and run it again. Don't use sudo!</li>
            <li>If it indicates a wrong libc version or something similar, there is no easy fix than compiling yourself.</li>
          </ul>
